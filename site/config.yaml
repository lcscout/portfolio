      I'm mostly a programmer but I have a strong interest in the intersection of technology and art. I'm very interested in render pipelines, shaders, software architecture and game optimizations. Currently, I work as a game developer at [Izyplay Game Studio](https://www.izyplay.com/).

      Besides work, I'm currently doing a bachelor's degree in Digital Games at PUC Minas. I'm also working on a personal project to be launched on Steam soon enough.

          At PICSIZE, I worked with a very small team of 6 people at a startup that provides solutions for photographers' workflow, from the moment they finish taking the photo to delivering it to their clients.

          - It was my first work experience, and I had the pleasure of being in touch with wonderful people from whom I learned a lot, both technically and personally üôè
          - After 4 months of internship I was invited to a part-time position.
          - At this point I was assigned to create a new solution on my own. The project was a portfolio creator, where photographers could easily show their work in a featured page. But ultimately, I ended up quitting the job.

          It was during high school that I came in contact with programming for the first time. I learned the basics of C++ Language and soon wanted to learn another one.

          - With the same will in mind a friend of mine started learning Python and I chose to learn Ruby (not my best decision üòõ), just to not copycat.
          - I learned it mostly by doing games using the Gosu gem, and it was pretty fun, this was also my introduction to game programming.
