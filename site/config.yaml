      I'm mostly a programmer but I have a strong interest in the intersection of technology and art. I'm very interested in render pipelines, shaders, software architecture and game optimizations. Currently, I work as a game developer at [Izyplay Game Studio](https://www.izyplay.com/).

      Besides work, I'm currently doing a bachelor's degree in Digital Games at PUC Minas. I'm also working on a personal project to be launched on Steam soon enough üëÄ

          It was during high school that I came in contact with programming for the first time. I learned the basics of C++ Language and soon wanted to learn another one.

          - With the same will in mind a friend of mine started learning Python and I chose to learn Ruby, just to not copycat üòõ
          - I learned it mostly by doing games using the Gosu gem, and it was pretty fun, this was also my introduction to game programming.
