<br>

This was a project I was doing with a friend. It is a fighting game with gameplay inspired in Super Smash Bros. and with the One Piece thematic since we are both fans of the franchise.

A demo is available [here](https://lcscout.itch.io/romance-brawl). Although the **servers are down**.

## Afterthoughts
---
A friend of mine was starting to lear programming and game dev and we started this project together to study. We reached this idea of doing a game similar to smash bros but using sprites from the One Piece games, specially those of Nintendo DS.

For starters, I was really excited to do a multiplayer game since my last studies were based on that and I wanted to practice what I've learned. But reflecting now, doing a multiplayer was not the best idea for my friend as someone that just started learning game dev, maybe this was one of reasons the project fell apart ðŸ˜¥

Ignoring the ethical problems behind it, it was really fun to rip assets from old One Piece games. I found some great games I never heard of and actually had a blast playing them ðŸ˜…

And even though this project was abandoned I still want to return to it someday.
