This is a FPS game with rogue-like features that I made to practice what I've learned so far from the Unity course:Â [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).

Although it's a finished project I did not polish it because I thought it would be more benefitial to just move on and get better while doing other projects. That's said, bugs are expect.

## Contributions
---

I was the sole programmer of this game (well, the sole dev too ðŸ˜…) and I wanted to put in practice what I was learning at the time.

I did everything while using free assets, noteworthy:
 - The roguelike gameplay
 - The entire UI & UX
 - The player movement and enemies controller
 - The FPS camera

## Afterthoughts
---
As I said, I didn't polish the game. During that time I was learning how to use Unity and how to code in C#, so instead of putting a lot of effort and time trying to fix every bug and polishing the game I preferred to move on to other projects ðŸ˜”

Not polishing it wasn't a conscient choice at the beginning, but when I realized that I would have to refactor it I decided not to. I wanted to keep focusing on learning the basics, the core, and move on to apply this knowledge I gathered into the next projects.

I don't know if it was the correct choice at the time because this certainly led to bugs and performance issues â€” I have to admit that the code is a mess ðŸ˜–

The good thing is that after this project I started to care a lot more about software architecture and planning before coding instead of throwing stuff in and having to refactor everything later.
