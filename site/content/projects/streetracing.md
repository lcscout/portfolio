This is a single-player racing game where you try to finish the race the fastest you can, I did it as the last submission project for the Unity pathway:Â [Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).

<br>

## Contributions
---

I was the only one involved in this project. It was the last submission for Unity's learning pathway, focused on OOP principles.

Together with free assets, I designed and crafted everything. But mostly important:
- The racing gameplay
- The vehicles controller, using Unity's wheels physics
- The UI & UX

## Afterthoughts

Overall this was a good project to sharpen my basic skills, and even learn some new ones, for example, how to work with vehicle physics and doing a minimap. But I feel that I've done more mistakes than successes in this one.

I have to say that I actually ended up making the same mistakes I did in my last "majorish" project, I did not plan. I didn't plan the gameplay and I didn't plan the coding, also I didn't limit my scope â€” in this last subject, I actually wanted to just do something very small that implemented object-oriented programming since this was the goal of the submission, but things started to grow and I didn't realize (maybe cuz I wasn't working every day on it).

Frankly, this project took way too long for me to finish it. I was going through some personal problems and I happened to enter a cycle of feeling bad for being unproductive and being unproductive for feeling bad, although this ain't a excuse it definitely made way worse. And affected another [project](https://lucascoutinho.me/projects/gdstd3) that I was doing in parallel ðŸ˜”

So, eventually, I reached a moment where I was just not enjoying working on it anymore and wanted to just give it a finish, and once more I didn't even refactorate the code. In the code you can clearly see that in the beginning I was much more thoughtful of writing a good, concise code, on following game programming patterns... but at a point I was pretty much just throwing stuff there.

I know I could've done a lot more. I would've liked to improve the way the score is handled, to add more intricate gameplay elements and to add a sound management and certainly refactor the code but I felt that I was trying to build a house with a bad foundation whereas I should be making a Lego building all this time ðŸ˜ž

Anyway, I didn't like to make the same mistakes I've already made because it is like I didn't learn anything but I know I did, so, I guess I just need to keep going and really focus on absorbing and learning with what I'm doing wrong so things like that won't happen again.
