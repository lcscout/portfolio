Since my last project was a FPS and was also a kind of big one, I wanted to do a small project just to test TPS controlling and Unity's URP.

## Afterthoughts
---
I wanted to test out Unity's URP render pipeline because I was having some performance issues on my last project and I thought URP could help with this. And, well, I think it definitely helps but I can't say for sure by how much because the circumstances were quite different (last game was quite big, using a lot of modular assets).

Furthermore, when I finished this prototype I realized doing this type of project where you focus solely on what you want to learn helps a lot. So I decided to do a lot more of these whenever I feel I need to learn something specific, and so, I started this series of prototypes for studying game dev (hence the name haha ðŸ˜†)
