I made this prototype primarily for studying game AI and NavMeshes, but I also used it to understand a bit more about lighting in Unity.

## Afterthoughts
---
I've been wanting to learn about AI for a while so I decided to make a small prototype. I used the [Third Person Starter Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526) from Unity as a base so I could focus solely on my objective. The AI simply roams around and follow player when near, I wanted to also add a fighting element but I thought this would be out of the scope. I prefer to make another prototype focused on fighting and them one with the two combined.

I also saw an opening to understand the lighting on Unity a little better. With that I learnt how to use light probes to simulate dynamic lighting with a baked source.
