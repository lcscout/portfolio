<br>

This is a simple game where you control a submarine that needs to recover chest from the bottom of the ocean, by doing so you earn points. This was the first game I published on internet âš¡

<br>

## Summary
---
At the time I was still in web development and wanted to make a game.

It wasn't my first contact with gamedev but it was where I started considering that path. I choose something really simple so I could get familiarized with the framework I was using (Phaser.js). It was a very nice experience and making the sprites myself added to it ðŸ˜‡
