    On the other hand, I'm very interested in the intersection of technology and art. I enjoy studying render pipelines, shaders, software architecture and game optimizations.

    Ultimately, to produce games that are unique and impactful for whoever is going to play is my goal. I like to be creative and inventive when making new worlds for players to feel part of and making distinctive gameplay features for players to be excited about.

I've been in contact with videogames since I was little and I always liked to create worlds and my own stories, but I only realized that I wanted to get into games as a career later in my life ðŸŽ®

As far as my programmer mind goes, I'm very interested in software architecture and creating clean, reusable code, without throwing away maintainability and business logic integrity. I like to have a macro vision, to work on every part of a project or at least have a solid understanding of the whole ðŸ‘Š
